KSDSPACE  VSAM KSDS space use mapping utility (reports on space
          used by data records, free space, # of index records per
          IX level, low/high key per control area, unused space
          due to IX record too short).

KSDSPACO  Older version of KSDSPACE. Should run on unsupported
          levels of DFSMS (1.2 or less). It does not work with
          Extended Format/Addressability KSDS.

OFDVBFB   Converts sequential dataset from RECFM=VB to RECFM=FB

LLAUPDTX  Synchronous LLA update routine (using LLACOPY macro).
          One member per step (specified in PARM) gets refreshed.

LLAUPDTS  Synchronous LLA update routine (using LLACOPY macro).
          Multiple members (specified in SYSIN) get refreshed.

DEFNVS    Generates IDCAMS DEFINE NONVSAM statements for a DASD
          volume.

DELNVS    Generates IDCAMS DELETE NSCR statements for a DASD
          volume.

IEFUSI    A sample, configurable (working in a real production
          environment) SMF USI exit.

LDAPROBE  LDAP server probe REXX exec.
LDAPROBJ  JCL (could run as an STC) to run LDAPROBE.

MXIVSTOR  Dispalys virtual storage usage of an address space (REXX
          exec). Requires/ calls MXI to retrieve foreign address
          space LDA/ASCB/RAX/RAXMEMLIMIT.  This is essentially a
          modified Mark Zelden's REXXSTOR, except that input data
          from a foreign AS are retrieved via MXI.

TI        Displays RMM tape dataset info for an ISPF 3.4 dataset
          list entry using RMM LISTDATASET subcommand (REXX exec).

TV        Displays RMM tape volume info for an ISPF 3.4
          dataset list entry using RMM VOLUME subcommand (clist).

MAKENSWP  Makes all address spaces with same name nonswappable.
          This can be useful for Unix applications (in our case
          CTG). Does this via MXI MAKE command. This is a REXX
          exec.

JJDGEN    Janek's data records generation utility. Need a few
          records for testing of an application ? Try this !

WTOH      Write Message to Operator routine (highlighted
          messages).

$TABLES   See $TABLES doc member for description of general
          purpose binary search table processing routines/
          package.  This may be of interest for application
          programmers (writing applications in PL/I, COBOL,
          Assembler).

HALVE     Binary search tables processing subroutine

HLVTD     HALVE related macro: table definition

JJTBGEN   Create table to be searched/ processed by HALVE
          subroutine.

TBLACCSS  Tables access interface routine for COBOL programs
          (HALVE related).

KSDSINIT  New KSDS File Initialization Routine

JJPDSD    Deletes all members of a PDS dataset. It is slow/ poor
          performer with PDS datasets, but it works (better)
          with PDSE.

OFDASVER Checks if specified address space/s is/are up.
         If all specified address spaces are up - ends with return
         code of zero, otherwise ends with return code of 16.
         Possible use of this program:
         .Verify if a CICS or DBCOMM/DB region is up in the first
         step of a job. If yes, continue the job, otherwise
         terminate it.
         .Verify if all required STCs are up after IPL or
         periodically throughout a day. If not - issue a warning
         message.

Macros    SUBRET, SUBENT, TSTAMP, HLVTD
