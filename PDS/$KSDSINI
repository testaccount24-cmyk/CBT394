KSDS File Initialization Routine
--------------------------------

Specifications:

Module name: KSDSINIT

Attributes : STANDARD

Function = see below

   The routine initialyzes a newly defined VSAM KSDS file through the
following sequence of operations:
 .OPEN for output sequential processing
 .LOAD a dummy record (record, including key, is filled with blanks)
 .CLOSE the file
 .Re-OPEN the file for direct processing
 .DELETE the dummy record (GET for update and ERASE)
 .CLOSE the file
If the input file was previously loaded with a dummy (all blanks)
record - such a record will also be deleted.
After the run of this program - VSAM KSDS file can be opened for
INPUT/OUTPUT processing by an application program.
DDNAME of input KSDS data set is KSDS. Error messages are issued to
SYSPRINT file.
   When input KSDS cluster has AIXs with UPGRADE attribute,
the following procedure has to be followed to initialyze base cluster
and paths:
 1.DEFINE base cluster
 2.LOAD base cluster with a dummy record (all blanks including key)
   (you can use DATAGEN utility to generate a dummy record and IDCAMS'
   REPRO to load the cluster).
 3.DEFINE all UPGRADE AIXs
 4.DEFINE all PATHs
 5.BUILD all AIXs
 6.Run KSDSINIT with base cluster as input KSDS file

Return codes from the program:

    0 - Normal successful completion.
   16 - Error. Check messages in SYSPRINT and/or system log.



The following JCL procedure has been cataloged to run this program :

   //KSDSINIT PROC
   //KSDSINIT EXEC PGM=KSDSINIT
   //STEPLIB    DD DSN=SYS1.UTIL.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
   //KSDS       DD DSN=&KSDS,DISP=OLD
   //SYSPRINT   DD SYSOUT=*

   "KSDS" file has to be previously defined in "CAT" catalogue using
   IDCAMS.
