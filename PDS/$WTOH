Write Message to Operator routine ( highlighted messages )
----------------------------------------------------------

Module name: WTOH

Attributes : REUSABLE

Function = see below

    This routine writes message(s) to the operator. Message is
 highlighted and will stay on the console's screen until deleted by
 the operator. The program is intended to be used to inform
 operators about an important condition requiring their immediate
 attention.
    Message text can be passed either in PARM field or in SYSIN file.
 SYSIN file has to have 80 bytes records. Contents of columns 1-72 of
 each SYSIN record is written as separate "WTO" message. The routine
 will display up to max of 10 records from SYSIN in order to avoid
 flooding of the operator console with messages from problem programs.
 Both PARM and SYSIN inputs are optional. If both are specified - text
 from PARM will be displayed as the first message.

   Each WTO message has job name prefixed to it.

   This routine can be either invoked from JCL or dynamically through
 means of LINK or LOAD/CALL macros. Call format is the following :

  CALL WTOH,(parm {,ddname}),VL

       "parm" argument has to have the same format as OS operating
              system standard.
       "ddname" argument is optional and user can specify in it
              ddname of SYSIN message input file. Specifying blank
              "ddname" prevents WTOH from processing message file
              at all.

Sample execution from JCL :

  //WTOH   PROC
  //WTOH   EXEC PGM=WTOH,PARM='&MSG.'
  //       PEND
  //       EXEC WTOH,MSG='UPDATE OF "PRODUCE" MASTER FILE FAILED'
  //SYSIN    DD *
  IDENTIFY AND CORRECT THE ERRORS AND DO THE RERUN PROCEDURE
