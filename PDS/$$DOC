Please see @INDEX member + comments at the begining of every source
module. Every utility is documented in the source code.
Some utilities/subroutines have separate documentation member (name
beginning with $).

The original author of all programs in this file is Janek Jakubek,
except of macros SUBENT and SUBRET, which I cannot remember the origin.
Also, MXIVSTOR is a modified version of Mark Zelden's REXXSTOR.
